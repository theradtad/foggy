1. Syntax: It is important to understand the syntax of a language or a framework, but not neccessarily memorize it.
2. Language Concepts: Crucial for us to understand all the basic concepts of a language or a framework. Helps write better prompts.
3. Methods and method signatures: Important to know the capabilities supported by the framework, library or language. Method signatures not essential.
4. Design Patterns: It is essential to know the common design patterns of a language to help solve a problem in a cleaner, more structured manner.
5. Project Based Learning: The approach is to build projects to learn, even if it's as small as a hello world program.
