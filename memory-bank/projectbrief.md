# Project Brief: Foggy - Personalized Coding Tutor

## Core Mission
Foggy is an AI-powered personalized coding tutor that adapts to individual learning needs, helping developers master programming languages, frameworks, and libraries through structured, project-based learning experiences.

## Core Requirements
1. **Interactive Goal Assessment**: Agent converses with users to understand their learning objectives and current knowledge level
2. **Prerequisites Analysis**: Identifies and assesses user's knowledge of required prerequisites for their chosen technology
3. **Structured Learning Plans**: Creates section-wise learning plans covering:
   - Core concepts through conceptual understanding
   - Practical examples and implementations
   - Mini-projects for hands-on practice
4. **Progress Tracking**: Monitors user advancement through learning sections with persistent storage
5. **Evaluation & Feedback**: Provides assessment and constructive feedback on user work
6. **Redo Support**: Allows users to revisit and retry learning sections with different examples
7. **Q&A Support**: Enables questions about generated examples and concepts
8. **Multi-Agent Architecture**: Supports specialized agents for different learning phases

## Success Criteria
- Users can effectively learn new technologies through structured, adaptive learning paths
- Learning progress is accurately tracked and persisted across sessions
- Users receive timely, constructive feedback on their work
- The system scales to support multiple users and learning sessions
- Integration of web interface provides accessible learning experience

## Scope Boundaries
- Focus on programming languages, frameworks, and libraries
- Support CLI interface initially, with web interface as Phase 5 enhancement
- SQLite for structured data persistence, Markdown for content readability
- Single-user focus initially, with multi-user support as future enhancement

## Key Stakeholders
- **Primary Users**: Developers learning new technologies
- **Secondary Users**: Educators using the tool for structured learning programs
- **Maintainers**: Development team ensuring system reliability and feature evolution
