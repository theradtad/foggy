# Product Context: Foggy

## Why Foggy Exists

### The Problem
Traditional coding education faces significant challenges in the modern AI-assisted development landscape:

1. **Paradigm Shift**: AI coding assistants have fundamentally changed how developers work, making memorization of syntax less critical while elevating the importance of conceptual understanding and design patterns.

2. **Inefficient Learning**: Existing learning resources often follow one-size-fits-all approaches that don't account for individual knowledge gaps, learning pace, or specific project needs.

3. **Lack of Personalization**: Current educational tools don't adapt to a learner's existing knowledge or provide structured progression from concepts to practical application.

4. **No Progress Tracking**: Learners struggle to maintain momentum without clear visibility into their advancement and areas needing reinforcement.

5. **Limited Feedback Loops**: Without immediate, contextual feedback on practical work, learners can't effectively correct misunderstandings.

### The Solution
Foggy addresses these challenges by providing:

1. **Adaptive Learning Paths**: Conversational assessment to understand user goals and current knowledge, creating personalized learning trajectories.

2. **Structured Knowledge Building**: Each learning section follows a proven progression: conceptual understanding → practical examples → hands-on projects.

3. **Progress Persistence**: Comprehensive tracking of learning advancement with the ability to resume where left off.

4. **Intelligent Evaluation**: AI-powered assessment of user work with constructive feedback and suggestions for improvement.

5. **Redo Capabilities**: Support for revisiting sections with fresh examples when additional practice is needed.

## How Foggy Works

### User Journey
1. **Initial Assessment**: User specifies learning goal (e.g., "Learn React") and agent assesses prerequisite knowledge
2. **Plan Creation**: Agent generates structured learning plan with sections covering concepts, examples, and projects
3. **Guided Learning**: User progresses through sections with agent providing content and Q&A support
4. **Practical Application**: User completes mini-projects with real-time feedback
5. **Evaluation & Iteration**: Agent assesses work, provides feedback, and suggests redos if needed

### Key User Experience Principles
- **Human-in-the-Loop**: Every major decision requires user approval and input
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Information revealed gradually to avoid overwhelming learners
- **Immediate Feedback**: Quick assessment and guidance on practical work
- **Flexibility**: Users can modify plans, skip sections, or request different examples
- **Persistence**: Learning progress maintained across sessions

### Technical Architecture Vision
- **Multi-Agent System**: Specialized agents for planning, teaching, evaluation
- **Hybrid Storage**: SQLite for structured data, Markdown for human-readable content
- **Web-First Design**: Accessible interface through modern web technologies
- **Extensible Framework**: Support for new languages, frameworks, and learning methodologies

## Success Metrics
