# Product Context: Foggy

## Why Foggy Exists

### The Problem with Traditional Learning
In the age of AI coding assistants, traditional learning methods are becoming increasingly inadequate:

1. **Syntax Memorization vs. Understanding**: Most tutorials focus on syntax memorization, but AI handles syntax completion
2. **Outdated Content**: Many tutorials become outdated quickly with rapidly evolving frameworks
3. **Rigid Learning Paths**: Traditional courses follow fixed curricula that don't adapt to individual needs
4. **Lack of Real-World Context**: Academic-style learning often misses practical application patterns
5. **No Personalized Feedback**: Generic tutorials can't provide tailored guidance based on learning style

### AI's Impact on Development Workflow
AI has fundamentally changed how developers work:
- **Immediate Help**: AI can instantly provide syntax completion and basic examples
- **Faster Research**: Developers can quickly investigate new libraries and frameworks
- **Different Knowledge Needs**: Instead of memorizing APIs, developers need to understand concepts and patterns

### Current Learning Gaps
Despite AI assistance, developers struggle with:
- **Deep Concept Understanding**: Moving beyond syntax to architectural patterns
- **Practical Application**: Translating concepts into real projects
- **Learning Efficiency**: Maximizing effectiveness of study time
- **Framework Mastery**: Understanding design patterns and best practices specific to each technology
